    <h1>Tartan User Guide</h1>
    <h2>"Tartan Designer" Window</h2>
    <h3>Colours</h3>
    <p>
      'Tartan' is an application for designing Tartan patterns using colours from a configurable "Colour Palette".
      Each colour in the "Colour Palette" can be selected then changed using the "Selected Colour" control.
      Each colour swatch can be labelled using the adjoining text field.
    </p>
    <h3>Layout</h3>
    <p>
      The pattern layout can be controlled in a number of ways.
      "Tartan" uses a pattern that repeats after an specific number of threads.
      "Column Repeat Count" defines that number of vertical threads.
      Typically the pattern is the same for the vertical and horizontal threads and the "Duplicate the Column colours for the Rows" check box performs this duplication automatically.
      However, if this is not desired, uncheck the box and set the vertical and horizontal thread colours independently.
      This also allows the number of horizontal threads (before repeating) to be set independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guide lines divide the "Sample" window into eight equal parts vertically and horizontally.
      The "Show Guide Lines" check box controls whether these are displayed or not.
      The colour of the guide lines <b>AND</b> the colour of thread highlights can be changed using the colour selector labelled "Guide Line Colour".
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically multiple adjacent treads have the same colour.
      "Thread Repeat Count" colours up to eight adjacent threads using the currently selected colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The size of the threads can be increased using the "Thread Size" control, to make life easier during the design phase, however this will effect the generated graphic when saved.
      The thickness of the thread border can be adjusted using the "Thread Border Thickness" control, if needed.
    </p>
    <h3>Pull-Down Menu</h3>
    <p>
      The Pull-Down Menu allows tartan designs to be loaded from and saved to the <code>Tartan/swatches</code> directory.
      Each tartan design is saved in it's own subdirectory as a settings file and includes a .png image file showing the design repeated in a 2 by 2 layout.
    </p>
    <h2>"Sample" Window</h2>
    <h3>Colouring</h3>
    <p>
      Across the top edge and down the left side of the "Sample" window are extended threads which are sensitive to mouse movement and clicking.
      Moving the mouse pointer over these areas will cause threads to be highlighted based on the current selections.
      Clicking on these areas will colour the highlighted threads using the currently selected colour from the "Colour Palette".
    </p>
    <h3>Adjusting</h3>
    <p>
      Additionally, threads can be inserted or deleted.
      With the focus on the "Sample" window, holding down the "alt" or "ctrl" key will display a message in the "Sample" heading bar to indicate functional options:
      <ul>
        <li>With the "alt" key held down, clicking on the extended threads will <b>delete</b> the highlighted number of threads.</li>
        <li>With the "ctrl" key held down, clicking on the extended threads will <b>insert</b> the highlighted number of threads.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
